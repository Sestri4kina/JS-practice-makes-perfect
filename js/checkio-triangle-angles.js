 *
 * The Angles of a Triangle
 * You are given the lengths for each side on a triangle.
 * You need to find all three angles for this triangle.
 * If the given side lengths cannot form a triangle (or form a degenerated triangle),
 * then you must return all angles as 0 (zero).
 * The angles should be represented as a list of integers in ascending order.
 * Each angle is measured in degrees and rounded to the nearest integer number (Standard mathematical rounding).
 *
 * Input: The lengths of the sides of a triangle as integers.
 * Output: Angles of a triangle in degrees as sorted list of integers.
 * How it is used: This is a classical geometric task.
 * The ideas can be useful in topography and architecture.
 * With this concept you can measure an angle without the need for a protractor.
 * Precondition: 0 < a,b,c â‰¤ 1000
